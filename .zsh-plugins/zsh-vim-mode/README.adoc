Friendly bindings for ZSH's vi mode

== Installation
:zshplugmgr: https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/blob/master/README.md#installation
:issue-8: https://github.com/softmoth/zsh-vim-mode/issues/8

Install this plugin with any {zshplugmgr}[ZSH plugin manager], or just
source it from your `.zshrc`:

```
# In .zshrc
source "$HOME/zsh-vim-mode/zsh-vim-mode.plugin.zsh"
```

To {issue-8}[avoid conflicts], load these plugins in the following order if you use
them:

```
zsh-autosuggestions
zsh-syntax-highlighting
zsh-vim-mode
```

== Additional key bindings

In INSERT mode (`viins` keymap), most Emacs key bindings are available. Use
`^A` and `^E` (or `<Home>` and `<End>`) for beginning and end of line, `^R`
for incremental search, etc.

=== Surround Bindings for ZSH text objects
:surroundbindings: https://sourceforge.net/p/zsh/code/ci/master/tree/Functions/Zle/surround

ZSH has support for text objects since 5.0.8. This plugin adds the
{surroundbindings}[suggested bindings]
to use surround-type objects. For example, when in
NORMAL mode with the cursor inside a double-quoted string, type `ci"` to
change the contents of the string. Or type `cs"(` to change the quotes to
parentheses. Type `ds(` to remove the parentheses. Type `ys2W]` to surround
the following two Words with brackets.

In visual mode, type `a[` to select the surrounding bracketed text
(including the brackets), or type `i'` to select the text within single
quotes. Type `S<` to put angle brackets around the selected text.

=== `KEYTIMEOUT`

The time it takes for `<Esc>` to switch to NORMAL mode tends to be
`KEYTIMEOUT`, as there are bindings beginning with the escape character and
ZSH has to wait to see if the user is typing one of them. Pressing any key
(that doesn't follow `<Esc>` in a binding) will resolve this, and
immediately enter NORMAL mode and apply the key. So usually this timeout is
not a practical concern.

Shortening the timeout can make the switch into NORMAL mode feel snappier.
However, setting `KEYTIMEOUT=1`, as is often recommended, can cause subtle
problems. A very short timeout effectively disables multi-key commands in
NORMAL mode, which must be typed within the duration. For example, if you
try to type `cs")` and the duration between `c` and `s` is over
`KEYTIMEOUT`, the `s` will be treated separately and will take you back to
INSERT mode.

==== Minimal solution

The minimal workaround is to avoid defining any key bindings that start with
`<Esc>X`, where `X` is a key you might use first in NORMAL mode (such as the
movement keys `h` or `k`, for example). Use `<Esc>` as always, and
just trust that the next key you type will be handled properly in NORMAL
mode.

This plugin is careful to avoid bindings in INSERT mode that might conflict
with switching to NORMAL mode. You can configure which bindings it adds:

```zsh
# Put this in .zshrc, before this plugin is loaded
# Enable <Esc>-prefixed bindings that should rarely conflict with NORMAL mode
VIM_MODE_ESC_PREFIXED_WANTED='^?^Hbdfhul.g'  # Default is '^?^Hbdf.g'
```

Please open an issue if you run find a conflicting binding you can not turn
off (or are missing a handy Emacs-like binding that you can't turn on).

==== Removing bindings
:zguide: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/zshguide04.html#l95

One hard-core workaround is to
{zguide}[remove all bindings starting with `<Esc>`],
but that includes very useful bindings such as arrow keys. This makes ZSH
immediately enter NORMAL mode when `<Esc>` is hit, but most people will not
want to lose all of those bindings. But you could unbind _double_ escapes;
that way you only lose Alt-Left and Alt-Right for word movement in INSERT
mode:

```zsh
# Put this in .zshrc, after this plugin is loaded
bindkey -rpM viins '^[^['
```

Pressing `<Esc><Esc>` will then switch to NORMAL mode with no delay,
every time.

==== Changing the command key

One more option is to use another key, like `<Ctrl-D>`, to switch into NORMAL
mode. Since there are no key bindings that start with `<Ctrl-D>`, ZSH can
immediately switch to NORMAL mode when this key is hit. This plugin provides
a setting for this behavior:

```zsh
# Add to .zshrc, before this plugin is loaded:
# Use Control-D instead of Escape to switch to NORMAL mode
VIM_MODE_VICMD_KEY='^D'
```

You'll probably want to do this in your editor, too, so your muscle memory
works in both the shell and editor.

```vim
" Add to .vimrc
" Use Control-D instead of Escape to switch to NORMAL mode
inoremap <C-d> <Esc>
```

==== Wrap conflicting bindings with disambiguation widgets
:issue-33: https://github.com/softmoth/zsh-vim-mode/issues/33

A hack is provided in {issue-33}[issue #33] to use surrounds while keeping
`KEYTIMEOUT=1`. The code can simply be copied into `.zshrc` after loading
this module.

=== Disabling default keybindings

Out of the box, various common keybindings for vim mode are defined. If this 
does not suit your purposes, you can disable them easily:

```
VIM_MODE_NO_DEFAULT_BINDINGS=true
```

== Editing keymap tracking

This plugin carefully tracks the editing mode state in order to provide
feedback about what keymap is active. While ZSH provides basic support for
this via its `$KEYMAP` variable, that only switches between `viins` (INSERT)
and `vicmd` (NORMAL) modes.

The `$VIM_MODE_KEYMAP` variable is set to `viins`, `vicmd`, `replace`,
`isearch`, `visual` or `vline`. This is available for easy inspection from
other plugins or prompt themes.

=== Disabling keymap tracking

Tracking the keymap at this level requires hooking in to the ZSH line editor
for each keystroke. While the goal is for this to be efficient and
trouble-free, you may want to disable it entirely if you do not use the
feedback it provides. To disable _all_ mode-sensitive feedback and
behavior from this plugin,
__including cursor styling, prompt indicator and initial keymap__,
set this:

```zsh
# Disable all tracking of editing keymap, cursor styling, prompt indicators,
# etc.
VIM_MODE_TRACK_KEYMAP=no
```

=== Mode-sensitive cursor styling
:SsSe: https://github.com/softmoth/zsh-vim-mode/issues/23#issuecomment-627991663

Change the color and shape of the terminal cursor with:

```zsh
MODE_CURSOR_VIINS="#00ff00 blinking bar"
MODE_CURSOR_REPLACE="$MODE_CURSOR_VIINS #ff0000"
MODE_CURSOR_VICMD="green block"
MODE_CURSOR_SEARCH="#ff00ff steady underline"
MODE_CURSOR_VISUAL="$MODE_CURSOR_VICMD steady bar"
MODE_CURSOR_VLINE="$MODE_CURSOR_VISUAL #00ffff"
```

Use `#RRGGBB` notation for  for colors. Your terminal application may
recognize X11 color names, `rgb:xxx/yyy/zzz` or other formats.

The recognized style words are `steady`, `blinking`, `block`, `underline`
and `bar`.

If your cursor used to blink, and now it's stopped, you can fix that with
`unset MODE_CURSOR_DEFAULT`. The default (steady) is appropriate for most
terminals.

If you are using `tmux` and cursor styles are not shown, first ensure that
your terminal application {SsSe}[reports its capabilities] properly. If it
is an old version of tmux, you may need to set `TMUX_PASSTHROUGH=1` to
get the cursor styling to work.

When in VISUAL or VLINE mode, ZSH colors text in reverse (background and
foreground colors swapped). Depending on your terminal, this may override or
interfere with the cursor color. Using `bar` or `underline` may display
better than `block` in some cases.

==== Disabling cursor styling

Cursor styling is not enabled by default. If you do not set any
`MODE_CURSOR_*` variables, the terminal escape sequence to change
the cursor is not sent.

=== Mode in prompt

If RPS1 / RPROMPT is not set, the mode indicator will be added
automatically. The appearance can be set with:

```zsh
MODE_INDICATOR_VIINS='%F{15}<%F{8}INSERT<%f'
MODE_INDICATOR_VICMD='%F{10}<%F{2}NORMAL<%f'
MODE_INDICATOR_REPLACE='%F{9}<%F{1}REPLACE<%f'
MODE_INDICATOR_SEARCH='%F{13}<%F{5}SEARCH<%f'
MODE_INDICATOR_VISUAL='%F{12}<%F{4}VISUAL<%f'
MODE_INDICATOR_VLINE='%F{12}<%F{4}V-LINE<%f'
```

If you want to add this to your existing RPS1, there are two ways. If
`setopt prompt_subst` is on, then simply add ${MODE_INDICATOR_PROMPT}
to your RPS1, ensuring it is quoted:

```zsh
setopt PROMPT_SUBST
# Note the single quotes
RPS1='${MODE_INDICATOR_PROMPT} ${vcs_info_msg_0_}'
```

If you do not want to use prompt_subst, then it must **not** be
quoted, and this module must be loaded first before adding it
to your prompt:

```zsh
setopt NO_prompt_subst

# Load this plugin first, then later on ...

MODE_INDICATOR_VICMD='%F{9}<%F{1}<<%f'
MODE_INDICATOR_SEARCH='%F{13}<%F{5}<<%f'
# Note the double quotes
RPS1="${MODE_INDICATOR_PROMPT} %B%F{15}<%b %*"
```

Each time the line editor keymap changes, the *text* of the prompt
will be substituted, removing the previous mode indicator text and
inserting the new.

If your theme sets `$MODE_INDICATOR`, it will be used as a default
for `MODE_INDICATOR_VICMD` if nothing else is set.

==== Disabling mode indicator in prompt

If you set `MODE_INDICATOR=""`  _before_ loading this plugin, and none
of the other `MODE_INDICATOR_*` variables are set, then the prompt
is not modified by this plugin.

== Changing the initial editing keymap

ZSH initially is in INSERT mode (the `viins` keymap) with each new command
prompt. If you want to always start in NORMAL mode (the `vicmd` keymap), set
`VIM_MODE_INITIAL_KEYMAP=vicmd`. If you want to keep the mode you were in on
the last command line, set `VIM_MODE_INITIAL_KEYMAP=last`.

For example, if you type `<Esc>` to switch to NORMAL mode, then type `BBBdw`
to go back three Words and delete a word, you are still in NORMAL mode. If
you type `<Enter>` to submit the command, and `VIM_MODE_INITIAL_KEYMAP` is
set to `last`, you will be placed in NORMAL mode at the next command prompt.

== Compatibility

This plugin uses features added in ZSH 5.3 (`add-zle-hook-widget`, etc.).


== Bugs

If you find this doesn't work with your terminal, your plugins, your
settings or your version of ZSH, please {issues}[open an issue]. If
it clobbers some setting that it shouldn't, please open an issue.

It is usually helpful to create a clean `.zshrc` that only contains
`source ~/path-to/zsh-vim-mode/zsh-vim-mode.plugin.zsh`. If your
issue disappears, then please start adding back items from your
configuration until you find one that causes the problem. Put that test
`.zshrc` in the bug report. Thanks!
